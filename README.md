# Android Sharing App: Capstone Project - Object oriented Design

This repository contains the source code for my capstone project in the Object Oriented Design course at the University of Alberta (Coursera). 
The project is a simple Android app that was expanded during the capstone project, to allows users to manage 
not only their inventory but also their contacts.

## Features

- **Manage Contacts**:
    - Add new contacts with username and email.
    - Edit and delete contacts.
    - Validate duplicate contacts.

- **Inventory Management**:
    - Add items to your inventory.
    - Edit items to mark them as "Borrowed" or "Available".
    - Select the borrower from your contact list.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Run the app on your device or emulator.

## Usage

Start from the Main Activity, where you can choose to manage your inventory or to switch
to the contacts activity (top-right corner, under the Menu icon).

## Demo Video

Check out on Youtube a [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcL3UbWWOKc) of the app in action.
